2.2.3 Feedback and no-feedback
Feedback refers to whether the runtime information can serve to guide the generation of the test case in the next loop. Feedback techniques are mainly based on path coverage. No-feedback fuzzing does not obtain any information from the program execution.

Coverage-guided fuzzers (Zalewski, 2016; Google, 2017a, 2017b) obtain the path coverage information generated by the instrumentation tools (Bhansali et al., 2006; Luk et al., 2005; Nethercote and Seward, 2007; Bruening, 2017; Paradyn, 2017). This information is then used to guide the generation of the test case in the next loop to maximize the path coverage. Examples include AFL (Zalewski, 2016), honggfuzz (Google, 2017a), and Syzkaller (Google, 2017b).
